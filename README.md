Roth2 is a low-poly mesh body specifically designed for OpenSimulator. It is built to use standard Second Life(TM) UV maps using scratch-built open source mesh by Shin Ingen, Ada Radius and other contributors from the OpenSimulator Community.

## Bakes on Mesh

Roth2 v2 is a single layer mesh that is designed to work well with Bakes on Mesh.  It still has a simplified alpha capability and skin textures may be applied, but in Bakes on Mesh mode system layer alpha masks can be worn to give more control over hidden areas.

## Current Release

Roth2 v2 prepared on 2020-05-24 is the current release.

## Previous Release

Previous releases of Roth2 may be found in the old Ruth repo on Github and
in a number of places both in Second Life and OSGrid as listed above.

What was formerly called Roth 2.0 RC#1 is now referred to as Roth2 v1 in the current version naming scheme.

## Contrib (Personal) Directories

We have personal directories under the top-level 'Contrib' directory as a place for
team members to put things that are still under development before (or until)
they are merged into the master release directories.

## Upload Collada (.dae)

Since not everyone is set up to perform Blender exports to get the Collada
files for uploading we maintain recent exported .dae files in the Mesh directory.

## Other Artifacts

There is also an OpenSim IAR file that can be used to pre-load OpenSim grids.
These are usually updated at releases. They will help maintain consistent UUIDs
for the assets to minimize duplication when meshes and related assets are used
in world.

## Licenses

Roth2 is AGPL licensed, other contents of this repository are also
AGPL licensed unless otherwise indicated.  See LICENSE.md for specific details.

## Changes from Roth2 v1

The Ruth2 and Roth2 repositories have been extracted from the original Ruth 2.0
repo, retaining all Git history of the files that have been moved.  Some common
files will be moved later to a common repo.  Below is the list of changes for the
files present in this repo:

* Licenses.txt -> LICENSE.md
* Mesh/Avatar Roth/IARs -> Artifacts/IAR
* Mesh/Avatar Roth/Scripts -> Scripts
* Mesh/Avatar Roth/Textures -> Textures

## Reference Files

The original Ruth repo contained a number of reference files archived from
various places around the Internet.  Some of those have become hard to find
due to link rot and sites vanishing.

Those archived files are now in their own repo https://github.com/RuthAndRoth/Reference.
