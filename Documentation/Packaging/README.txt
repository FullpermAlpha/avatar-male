============================================================
BAKES ON MESH

Roth2 v2 is a single layer mesh that is designed to work well with Bakes on Mesh.  It still has a simplified alpha capability. Skin textures may still be applied, but in Bakes on Mesh mode system layer alpha masks can be worn to give. more control over hidden areas.

============================================================

KNOWN ISSUES AND TROUBLESHOOTING

There may be a small gap or seem at the neck joint between the mesh body and the classic avatar or addon mesh heads.

Not all the appearance sliders will work on the mesh body and parts.

Roth2 v2 with attached Bento head will work with most shapes. The headless body, to use with system head or other mesh head, will work well with the sliders except body fat, and extremes to neck length and thickness, because of the neck seam. There are a few head sliders that don't work: Head Shape, Ear Angle, Jowls, Chin Cleft.  Things on the list for another release sometime down the road: figure out the neck issue, improve pointy ears.

Foot skin problems? For best result, paint over the system toenails and remove as much detail as you can from your foot skin that is probably designed for the system avatar's duck feet.
