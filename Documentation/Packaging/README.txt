Roth2 - Open Source Mesh Avatars for Virtual Worlds

Roth2 v2 is based on Roth 2.0 RC#1 (now referred to as Roth2 v1).

Roth2 is a low-poly mesh body specifically designed for OpenSimulator. It is built to use standard Second Life(TM) UV maps using scratch-built open source mesh bodies by Shin Ingen with other open source contributions from the OpenSimulator Community.

TROUBLESHOOTING

Neck Seam or Neck Break problem?
