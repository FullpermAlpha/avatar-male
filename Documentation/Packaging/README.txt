============================================================
BAKES ON MESH

Roth2 v2 is a single layer mesh that is designed to work well with Bakes on Mesh.  It still has a simplified alpha capability and skin textures may be applied, but in Bakes on Mesh mode system layer alpha masks can be worn to give more control over hidden areas.

TROUBLESHOOTING

Foot skin problems? For best result, paint over the system toenails and remove as much detail as you can from your foot skin that is probably designed for the system avatar's duck feet.

Please send us your feedback by posting on our Discord Channel.
