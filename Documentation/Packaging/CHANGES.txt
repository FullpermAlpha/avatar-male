Roth2 v2 - Open Source Mesh Avatar for Virtual Worlds

Roth2 v2 is a single layer mesh that is designed to work well with Bakes on Mesh. Compared to Roth2.0 RC#1 (now also known as Roth2 v1) it has a simplified alpha capability. Skin textures may still be applied, but in Bakes on Mesh mode system layer alpha masks can be worn to give more control over hidden areas.

Known Issues
