Roth2 v2 - Open Source Mesh Avatar for Virtual Worlds - a single layer mesh that is designed to work well with Bakes on Mesh. Compared to Roth2.0 RC#1 (now also known as Roth2 v1) it has a simplified alpha capability. Skin textures may still be applied, but in Bakes on Mesh mode system layer alpha masks can be worn to give more control over hidden areas.
