# Roth2 Mesh

This directory includes both the Blender source files and Collada (.DAE) export
files from Blender.

Note: Some objects that were created using other means may not have .blend source files
(such as in-world prim objects exported to Collada).

* **DAE/Roth2-v2-Full_Body-Feet-Hands-Head.dae**: the complete Roth2 export

* **DAE/Roth2-v2-Hands.dae**: hands only (note, this includes a small amount of arms in a separate face)

* **DAE/Roth2-v2-Head.dae**: head only (note the face mappings are more detailed than the other head models)

* **DAE/Roth2-v2-Head-Vneck.dae**: head plus neck and some of the torso area suitable for use under V-neck tops

* **DAE/Roth2-v2-Headless_Body-Feet-Hands.dae**: all of Roth2v2 except the head
