I was trying to recall where I was with the Roth project 8 months ago but with too many Roth Blender Files in my hardrive,
I just simply could not find the last upload.

A little bit of history might help.

The last version of Roth that came from Ada Radius was --Edit#1.2-- and at that time she said it is done. My in-world testing shows that Roth appears to have boobs and saggy at that. I sculpted the UV map a bit around the chest area to relax the UV vertices following the natural topology and that did the trick of raising that boobies but with one major problem. A pinch around the armpit now make him appear to have a budding boobies.

Why is that a problem?

Most male skins have muscle tone painted on them and using that with Roth will really make him appear to have big rounded boobies. The more detail the skin has, the uglier it gets.

I believe at the time my solution was a new toned down topology, and I believe that is where I left it.
